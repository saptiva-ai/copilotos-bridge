### ✨ New Features

#### 🔔 **P1-HIST-009: Professional Error Handling**
*Commit: `c03e8ab`*

**Toast Notification System:**
- Integrated `react-hot-toast` with Saptiva dark theme
- Non-intrusive bottom-right positioning
- Color-coded: mint (#49F7D9) for success, red for errors
- Auto-dismiss: 3s (success), 5s (error)

**Intelligent Retry Logic:**
- Exponential backoff: 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s delays
- Jitter (0-1000ms) to prevent thundering herd
- Max 3 retries for network/5xx errors
- Smart predicate: only retry recoverable errors

**Error Boundaries:**
- Graceful degradation on component crashes
- Specialized fallback for ConversationList
- Error logging in development mode
- "Retry" and "Reload" buttons for recovery

**Store Improvements:**
- Optimistic updates with automatic rollback
- All mutations (rename/pin/delete) protected
- Toast feedback on every user action
- Structured logging (debug/warn/error)

**Files Added:**
- `apps/web/src/components/providers/ToasterProvider.tsx` (67 lines)
- `apps/web/src/lib/retry.ts` (190 lines - exponential backoff)
- `apps/web/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (150 lines)
- `docs/P1-HIST-009_ERROR_HANDLING.md` (400+ lines guide)

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx`: Added ToasterProvider
- `apps/web/src/lib/store.ts`: Enhanced 3 mutations with toasts + retry
- `apps/web/package.json`: Added react-hot-toast@2.6.0

**Code Stats:** +480 lines

#### ⚡ **P1-HIST-007: High-Performance Virtualization**
*Commit: `f86a84a`*

**Performance Improvements:**
- **25x-50x faster** rendering for large lists
- 60fps smooth scrolling with 500+ conversations
- Constant memory usage (~20 items rendered)
- Only renders visible items in viewport

**Smart Activation:**
- Automatic: >50 conversations → virtualized list

- Transparent switching without breaking changes

**Features Preserved:**
- All hover actions (rename/pin/delete)
- Inline rename with Enter/Escape
- Active item highlighting
- Auto-scroll to selected conversation
- Pin indicator badges

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `react-window` (6KB, modern alternative to react-virtualized)
- `FixedSizeList` with 72px item height
- Overscan count: 5 for smooth scrolling
- Smart scroll positioning on mount/change

**Files Added:**
- `apps/web/src/components/chat/VirtualizedConversationList.tsx` (280 lines)
- `docs/P1-HIST-007_VIRTUALIZATION.md` (500+ lines guide)
- `scripts/test-error-handling.sh` (manual testing script)

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/src/components/chat/ConversationList.tsx`: Conditional virtualization
- `apps/web/package.json`: Added react-window@2.1.2

**Code Stats:** +295 lines

  - BroadcastChannel API for instant updates
  - Polling with backoff as fallback

#### **Future Enhancements:**
- P2-HIST-010: Full keyboard navigation + ARIA (2 days)
- P2-HIST-011: Analytics and telemetry (1 day)
- Backend pagination for >1000 conversations

#### **Product Decisions Needed:**
